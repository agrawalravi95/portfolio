			<p class="work__paragraph">
				When I joined Spinny, the end user website was way ahead in terms of experience than most of the competition in the online used car buying and selling space, the internal apps and CRM however, lacked a lot design-wise. It had been 8 months since the inception of public face of Spinny and they hired as a UX Designer to understand the users better and come up with fast beautiful solutions.

				First look at the dashboard and I had already put a knife in my eye for its absolute brutal use of eye catching red all over the interface. This was a pure developer's solution to problems, crafted by Ramanshu (CTO &amp; Co-Founder, Spinny). He was desperate to get a better version out in tight deadlines too.
